COVID-19 Visualization of Virus Origin &amp; Genetic Evolution


COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)
An AI challenge with AI2, CZI, MSR, Georgetown, NIH & The White House


**What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)


Task Details
What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution? What do we know about the virus origin and management measures at the human-animal interface?

Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:

Real-time tracking of whole genomes and a mechanism for coordinating the rapid dissemination of that information to inform the development of diagnostics and therapeutics and to track variations of the virus over time.
Access to geographic and temporal diverse sample sets to understand geographic distribution and genomic differences, and determine whether there is more than one strain in circulation. Multi-lateral agreements such as the Nagoya Protocol could be leveraged.
Evidence that livestock could be infected (e.g., field surveillance, genetic sequencing, receptor binding) and serve as a reservoir after the epidemic appears to be over.
Evidence of whether farmers are infected, and whether farmers could have played a role in the origin.
Surveillance of mixed wildlife- livestock farms for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in Southeast Asia.
Experimental infections to test host range for this pathogen.
Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans
Socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors for this spill-over
Sustainable risk reduction strategies.**
